# Joomla Uploader

WARNING: Don't use the script. It is only a test. It works for me, but I think the script is not well written. Helps are welcome!

*joomla-uploader.sh* should upload the whole locale Joomla!-installation, including the MySQL-database, to the remote server via FTP, without using SSH (my webhoster do not provide SSH...). To save time, the files are packaged into a ZIP-file and will be extracted on the remote server using a PHP-script. If you run the script for the first time, the whole Joomla!-installation will be uploaded. Subsequent calls will searching for changes since last call, and will only upload these changes. Therefore, the script is only useful, if you will edit your website from **one** computer. And you cannot use the Joomla!-backend of the remote server, because the database will be overwritten, the next time *joomla-uploader.sh* is used.

## Why Joomla Uploader

*joomla-uploader* could be useful for static "one-person"-websites: One person has a website as a local joomla-installation. He wants to upload the installation to a remote server. And when changing the local website, the remote server should be updated, without long synchronizing operations. But this means, that the website will be static: visitors could publish comments, but after running *joomla-uploader* all comments will be lost, because the database will be completely removed and substituded by the local database.
